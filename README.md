# Virtual_Meet_Reminder_Assistant
A Virtual Meet Reminder Assistant is a web tool that simplifies sending WhatsApp meeting reminders. User can enter meet details (topic, date, time, meet link) and invitee phone numbers. The app generates a formatted message preview and a list of "Click to Notify" links. Each link opens WhatsApp with the pre-filled message for a specific colleague.
